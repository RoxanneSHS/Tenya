'Tenya Thermidor' for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

Version 2.0

Tenya may be only twelve years old, but sheis very powerful for her age, having been trained by her mother to fight in Umberlee's name from the moment she could hold a stick... and now she is VERY angry.

The temple of Umberlee would beat out any last vestige left of the girl she was before her mothers murder. To save her from that, or if you'd just prefer she use her powers in a way more beneficial to you, take her along.

Although lacking in physical strength, she has a few special abilities, such as being able to cast Storm Shield like a cleric of Talos. She has also a mini-quest that will enable her to use her Bowl of Elemental control, and possibly pickup one or two other items along the way.

Tenya now features a small amount of PIDs (Player Initiated Dialogue). Press the speech button and then press on Tenya while she's in the party to have a little chat with her.

Her portrait has been retouched by Asthner on the Baldur's Gate forums, adding a bit more texture to her scarf.
